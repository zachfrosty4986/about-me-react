      <p>Hello! My name is Zachary and I am learning how to code with CSS, HTML, and soon JavaScript! I am currently employed at a local school district as a level 1 IT Technician. I started my own buisness on social media where I forecast and teach about the weather! Many people refer to me as "Zach Frost". I am learning more code to build applications to expand my buisness and a career change into the developer field!</p>
